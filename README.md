# Python Inflection
---
The least a newcomer to Python would need to know to kickstart their rate of mastering it. This will contain tutorials pertaining to the following:

* **Python Fundamentals:** A "Computer Science 101" look at data types, function syntax, and built-in Python functions. This consists of a Jupyter Notebook and a standard Python file. The former contains lesson tutorials and the latter is a way to test what you know.

* **Machine Learning 101:** The basics of classification, clustering, and regression with machine learning algorithms. The notebook covers a brief amount of material for each of those three categories of algorithm, and some simple challenges with prepped data.

Will likely cover further topics in the future, but for now I am sticking with subjects I know well. **Together, *Python Fundamentals* and *Machine Learning 101* can both be understood and completed in less than ten days.**
